Some good pull requests that haven't been accepted:

- https://github.com/imazen/slimmage/pull/37
- https://github.com/supercrabtree/k/pull/35
- https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/pull/147

These could be added to my CV, maybe. But just for reference, I'm listing them here.

I might have a patch or two for projects that don't use GitHub. I should check.
