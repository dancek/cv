Some good pull requests that haven't been accepted:

- https://github.com/imazen/slimmage/pull/37
- https://github.com/supercrabtree/k/pull/35
- https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/pull/147

These could be added to my CV, maybe. But just for reference, I'm listing them here.

Not including bug reports (though some of those have been valuable, too). Just commits. For a list with bug reports too, see: https://opensourcecontributo.rs/user/dancek

I might have a patch or two for projects that don't use GitHub. I should check.
