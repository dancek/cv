Colleagues often come to me with all kinds of (technical) questions, probably not because I know a lot but because **I love learning and helping others**.\n\nOne of my greatest achievements at HiQ was coming up with an optimization that brought the runtime of a performance-heavy business-critical piece of PL/SQL down by over 50%, after two other senior developers had decided it could not be optimized further. In some cases this meant over five minutes of time saved, which apparently corresponded to a lot of money.\n\nHighlights from my work on public websites includes implementing http://nordpoolspot.com/ and http://orion.fi/ (in teams of 2 developers, a designer and others).",
