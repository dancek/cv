        "summary": "At HiQ I've become a software development **generalist**, working mostly on web frontend and backend, but on occasion also continuos integration and test automation, deployment, and even database administration and UI design. Colleagues often come to me with all kinds of (technical) questions, probably not because I know a lot but because **I love learning and helping others**.\n\nOne of my greatest achievements at HiQ was coming up with an optimization that brought the runtime of a performance-heavy business-critical piece of PL/SQL down by over 50%, after two other senior developers had decided it could not be optimized further. In some cases this meant over five minutes of time saved, which apparently corresponded to a lot of money.\n\nMy major projects at HiQ include EPiServer (ASP.NET MVC) based CMS websites with varying frontend technologies for five different customers, two Ruby on Rails web sites/apps, an interactive visualization frontend for complex data, and one year of development and maintenance for a customer with over a dozen of interconnected systems.\n\nHighlights of my work on public websites include implementing http://nordpoolspot.com/ and http://orion.fi/ (in teams of 2 developers, a designer and others).",
